# for pretty urls in nginx, you need to rewrite requests like this http://mysite.com/a/version.json to http://mysite.com/a.php?__route__=/version.json
# that is, make your api's end point is passed via the __route__ parameter

# old way
rewrite /a(/.*) /a.php?__route__=$1 break;


# better way, using try_files
location ~ ^/a(/.*)$ {
   try_files $uri a.php?__route__=$1 =404;

   include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
   fastcgi_param    SCRIPT_FILENAME  $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
   fastcgi_index    index.php;
}
